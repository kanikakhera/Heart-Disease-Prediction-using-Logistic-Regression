# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
Tool used is RStudio version 3.4.2

This data set is from the UCI Machine Learning library and can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/processed.cleveland.data
Description:

This data set currently contains 303 instances, some of which aren't complete (some features may be missing for a certain instance). In the case that this happens, the instance has been removed. There are 14 relevant features which have been extracted, from a maximum of 76 in the total dataset.



Feature #14 has also been reduced to a binary problem to detect the presence of any vessel narrowing. In the unprocessed data set, the range of values for that feature are from 0 to 4, indicating which vessel(s) are narrowing.

Performance Specs:

Logistic Regression - 87% accuracy
SVM                 - 79% accuracy
